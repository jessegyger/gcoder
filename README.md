# Gcode Viewer and Editor

A web-based tool for visualizing and editing G-code for 3D printing, built with Three.js. Enjoy the convenience of using it offline by downloading the files and running them directly on your desktop.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive interface for 3D printing enthusiasts to view, edit, and analyze G-code files directly in the browser, even without an internet connection. Key features include:

  - **Real-time 3D Visualization:** See your G-code in 3D as you edit it.
  - **Interactive Editing:** Modify G-code directly with immediate visual feedback.
  - **Layer Navigation:** Easily jump between layers with custom search functionality.
  - **Measurement Tools:** Measure distances in the XY and Z planes for better understanding of your print paths.
  - **Customizable Build Plate:** Adjust the build plate size to match your printer.
  - **Offline Capability:** No need for a web server; just download and run in the browser.


### Prerequisites

  - Web Browser with WebGL support (for Three.js)
  - Basic understanding of G-code and 3D printing concepts

## Performance Considerations

 For larger gcode files over 30,000 lines, performance might vary based on hardware capabilities. 

### Installation (or lack there of)

1. **Download the repository:**
   - You can download the project as a ZIP file from GitHub or clone it if you prefer:
     ```
     git clone [your-repository-url]
     ```
     
2. **Run Locally:**
- No server needed; just open `index.html` in your web browser by double-clicking it or drag it into your browser.


### Usage

- **Input G-code:** 
  - Allows you to directly type, paste, load, or drag and drop G-code into the editor.

- **Visualize:** 
  - The 3D visualization updates in real-time as you scroll through the G-code in the editor.
  - Scroll to Render: As you scroll through the G-code, the visualization reflects the current line.
  - Render Limit: Controls how many lines of G-code are rendered at once.

- **Interact:** 
  - Search: Search for G-code commands or by layer. Use Enter to go to the next match, Shift + Enter for the previous match.
  - Measurement: Click on two points in the 3D visualization to measure distances in XY and Z planes.
  - Search Slider (Far right scroll bar): A vertical slider that lets you jump to specific search terms by scrolling.

   - Key Bindings:
    - Arrow Up/Down: Move to the next/previous G-code line.
    - Shift + Arrow Up/Down: Move by search phrase up or down.
    - Spacebar: Toggle play/pause of G-code simulation (when textarea not focused).
    - Double Click on Points: Jump to the corresponding line in the G-code editor.
    - Enter key in search: Go to next search match.
    - Shift + Enter key in search: Go to previous search match.
    - Escape: Clears measurement selections.
    - 
  - Pan, Zoom, Orbit:
    - Pan: Click-drag on the canvas with the mouse.
    - Zoom: Use the mouse scroll wheel or pinch on touch devices.
    - Orbit: Right-click or Shift + Left-click and drag to rotate the view around the model.
  
  - Pan, Zoom, Orbit: (Touch)
    -Pan: Single finger touch and drag
    -Zoom: Two finger pinch to zoom
    -Orbit: Three finger touch and drag

  - Buttons for:
    - Layer Navigation: Move to previous (üîº) or next (üîΩ) layer.
    - Speed Control: Adjust simulation speed with ‚è™ (slow down) and ‚è© (fast forward).
    - Toggle Views: Show/hide travel lines (üîπ) and switch between thin and thick line representation (‚ïë).
    - Simulation: Play or pause (‚ñ∂Ô∏è), go to top (‚è´), bottom (‚è¨), move line up (‚¨ÜÔ∏è) or down (‚¨áÔ∏è).

- **Save:** 
  - Save G-code: Saves the current G-code in the editor to a file.
  - Load File: Loads G-code from a file into the editor. Supports drag and drop or file selection.

## Code Structure
  - **index.html:** Main HTML file with the structure for the viewer and editor.
  - **style.css:** Contains styling for the UI elements.
  - **three.js:** The Three.js library for 3D rendering (included for offline use).
  - **3.js:** Custom Three.js setup for the G-code visualization.
  - **gcodeCommands.js:** A JSON or JavaScript file defining G-code commands for quick reference.
